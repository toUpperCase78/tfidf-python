Xbox Series X Update Finally Makes Xbox One Game Discs Playable Offline

You won't need to be online to play your Xbox One game discs on an Xbox Series X console.

A recent Xbox Series X update has changed a DRM feature on that console, as you'll now be able to play Xbox One discs on the
current-gen console without needing to be connected to the internet. Microsoft confirmed online check-ins will no longer be
required thanks to the update, which had been spotted by fans earlier this month.

"This is true since the 2206 update," Xbox engineering lead Eden Marie tweeted." We examined date since Series X|S launch
and determined the online compatibility check isn't needed in the vast majority of cases for Xbox One discs. Some games may
still need to be updated online after install to ensure the best experience."

The patch notes for the 2206 updates - which rolled out in June and July - vaguely mentioned "general stability and performance
improvements" that have become the norm with these updates. The change to Xbox One DRM brings those last-gen games in line with
Xbox Series X|S titles, as those discs are also playable on the console without an online connection.

You'll still need an internet connection for the classic Xbox and Xbox 360 backwards compatibility games due to the
authentication setup of that library, but this new update will make a huge number of Xbox One titles - many of which have
Smart Delivery upgrades available - more accessible to users who don't always have a reliable online connection.

In other Xbox news, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer confirmed that there won't be a price increase for Xbox Series X|S
consoles, Xbox might acquire more studios in the future, and you can read up on how to connect Discord to your Xbox console.
