World's Biggest Gaming Company, Tencent, Hires Former PlayStation Boss Shawn Layden

Tencent is a bigger gaming company than Xbox and PlayStation, and now Layden has signed on to work there.

Former PlayStation boss Shawn Layden has announced his next move. He recently joined Chinese technology Tencent, which is the
biggest gaming company on Earth, to become a strategic advisor. He made the announcement on LinkedIn (via VGC).

"In this new role, I hope to advise, assist, and support the team at Tencent as they deepen their activities and commitments
within the industry to which I've devoted the majority of my career," Layden said. "We are at an epoch defining moment in
gaming and interactive entertainment. There are many possible roads ahead but only a few are profound, broadening, inclusive,
edifying, inspiring, and/or sustainable. I am thrilled to continue this journey of discovery and thank Tencent for the
opportunity."

Layden started at PlayStation in 1996 and worked his way up to become SIE Worldwide Studios chairman before exiting the
company in 2019. In addition to Tencent, Layden is a strategic consultant for Streamline Media Group, which helps "transport
brands into the metaverse."

Tencent is largest gaming company on the planet today, ahead of PlayStation and Xbox, according to Microsoft's Phil Spencer.

Tencent owns League of Legends studio Riot and Path of Exile developer Grinding Gear, and it has investments in Epic,
Activision Blizzard, Ubisoft, and many more. The company is creating its own western studios, too, recently setting up a new
outfit headed up by people who worked on Start Wars, Halo and Battlefield.

As for PlayStation, a recent report said a hardware revision is coming with a detachable drive.
