# tfidf-python

_A simple yet useful TF-IDF Python class_

## Overview

This TF-IDF implementation performs the following below:

* Constructs an IDF corpus and stopword list either from documents specified by the user, or by reading from input files
* Displays the current status of TF-IDF
* Creates tokens based on the regular expression
* Computes IDF for a specified term based on the corpus
* Generates keywords ordered by TF-IDF for a specified document
* Saves the corpus and non-stopword files to the storage
